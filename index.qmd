# Title 1 Header

My name is Grant Orchard and I am currently a student at BYU-Idaho. I am seeking a degree in Data Science with a minor in Statistics. I haven't don't many projects, but I am willing to learn and I am new in my major. I want to work for a Data Consulting Firm upon graduation and one day begin my own Data Consulting Firm, bringing in my own clients.
